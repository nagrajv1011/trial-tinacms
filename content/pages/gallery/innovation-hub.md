      USGS & PPSIJC has integrated STREAM as part of the curriculum. It is a
      time-tabled class, mandatory for students from grade 3 onwards, aiming to
      foster an innovative mindset in our students. It serves as a cornerstone
      in preparing students to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven
      world.
