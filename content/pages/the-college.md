          ### The PPSIJC Way


          Prabhavati Padamshi Soni International Junior College, endearingly
          called PPSIJC, came into force in the year 2008. Situated in the heart
          of the USGS campus, this awe-inspiring institution, in a very short
          span of time, has heralded itself as the true embodiment of an ideal
          haven for preparing students to make a victorious leap into university
          life. We acknowledge the significance of the formative years between
          school and university. In order to make these years productive as well
          as delightful for our students, we adopted the ‘A Level’ programme. At
          PPSIJC, we encourage learners to become confident, dynamic, resilient,
          innovative and passionate individuals who are driven to bring about a
          positive change in the world around them. With this global mindset, it
          is not surprising that PPSIJC has emerged as one of the best
          international colleges for A Level .

          The Cambridge Advanced (A Level) curriculum includes Cambridge
          International AS (Advanced Subsidiary) for Grade 11 and A Level
          (Advanced Level) for Grade 12. This curriculum offers the students a
          wide choice of subjects and provides students with a platform that is
          international in its outlook, yet retaining the local relevance. It is
          this perfect blend combined with a holistic learning environment at
          PPSIJC that make the two years of Junior College the best learning
          years of our students’ lives. By making the most of multiple
          opportunities to display their talents and develop their skills, our
          students prove themselves worthy of a strong foothold in any leading
          university worldwide. The in-depth study and application of knowledge
          helps them gain a clear understanding of the subjects, as well as
          shapes them into independent learners who are able to use their
          cognitive skills constructively.


          At PPSIJC, we chase the collective goal of creating praiseworthy
          individuals who are able to hold their own and significantly
          contribute to society for the greater good of humankind. We constantly
          strive to become the wind beneath the wings of our students to fly
          away into the world of enlightenment and success.
