          ### The USGS Way


          Welcome to Utpal Shanghvi Global School- the epitome of world-class
          education and empowerment.


          We are a K-12 co-educational International Day School offering an
          exceptional school experience to each of our learners. USGS is
          recognised as Mumbai’s premier international school. The School is
          affiliated to the CAIE (Cambridge Assessment International Education),
          and prepares students for the IGCSE (International General Certificate
          of Secondary Education) Year 10 examinations. In order to ensure a
          seamless transition from Class 10 to Junior College, we also offer
          students the opportunity to explore one of the finest qualifications-
          ‘A Levels’ at Prabhavati Padamshi Soni International Junior College
          (PPSIJC) situated within the USGS campus.\

          Since its inception in 1980, USGS has been setting benchmarks in the
          field of education. Through positive engagement and enriching learning
          experiences in a world-class facility, we ensure that all our students
          are “future-ready” for the opportunities and challenges that lie
          beyond the safety nest of USGS. The Cambridge International curriculum
          is highly respected all over the world, having produced some of the
          greatest thinkers, writers, leaders and scientists. We, at USGS, have
          taken up the baton to implement this ‘gold standard’ of education
          through our vision and innovation in teaching, learning and making a
          difference.


          The learner is at the centre of every decision we make and we provide
          ample opportunities for learners to discover a new dawn at every step
          of the way, guiding them into a future of hope and success. Through
          our holistic educational practices, we intend to create responsible,
          global citizens who embody the qualities of empathy, dedication,
          integrity and tolerance, thereby becoming true torchbearers of the
          USGS spirit.
