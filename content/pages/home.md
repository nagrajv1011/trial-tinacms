      Juhu Parle Education’s Society’s Utpal Shanghvi Global School and
      Prabhavati Padamshi Soni International Junior College is one of the
      topmost international schools in Mumbai following the Cambridge
      International curriculum right from Preschool up to A Level.


      Along with a stellar academic record, we are renowned for our range of
      co-curricular activities that offer our students the ideal platform for
      expressing themselves and attaining their highest potential. We instil in
      our students the desire to develop an informed curiosity, to question and
      explore, and apply their cognitive processes to everything they
      experience. This is implemented through several unique methods of learning
      that makes every student look forward to a new day at school.


      We hope to create a community of thinkers that will drive a new wave of
      thought and propel the world into an avant-garde kind of leadership that
      embraces the current trends and creates new ones; whilst still holding
      onto their precious cultural roots. Our keen focus on our students,
      commitment to excellence and dedication to consistent improvement with the
      changing times empowers our students to succeed in every arena of life.
      Our greatest strength lies in our commitment to creating a better world
      for our students- the shaping of an ideal world bit by bit.


      It is this core philosophy that has paid off and we have emerged as one of
      the finest educational institutions in Mumbai and it is with great
      pleasure and humility that we call ourselves- ‘Not just another school’.


      Fuelled by our philosophy, we have a powerful and dynamic team that
      constantly incorporates the latest and best educational practices; thus
      making USGS and PPSIJC one of the most sought-after and unparalleled
      schools in Mumbai.
