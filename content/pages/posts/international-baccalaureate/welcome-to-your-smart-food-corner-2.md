      We know that burgers and pizzas are not things to eat every day but these
      items are surely best when enjoyed in balance with fruits, vegetables,
      whole grains and legumes. Following the international health & hygiene
      standards, our management has planned out a custom designed menu for our
      IB PYP students. This will keep them full, prevent afternoon energy slumps
      and support healthy brain function, allowing them to take on the day.

      So, come and enjoy a luscious meal with friends. We also take pre-booking
      for our meals.

      Good nutrition means getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, but
      it also means enjoying lots of different foods. Make time for relaxed
      family meals that give your children the opportunity to really appreciate
      the food you prepare. Not only do they give you time to bond, regular
      meals help to establish a healthy eating schedule with a few snacks in
      between meals rather than grazing or eating small amounts throughout the
      day.

      Eating together and talking about the way food tastes and what goes into
      it can also help kids develop a healthy relationship with food and eating.
      As it takes time for fullness signals to travel from the stomach to the
      brain, slower, more mindful meals teach kids to tap into their sense of
      satiety to prevent overeating.

      When it comes to nutrition for kids’ growth, the most persuasive message
      of all may be non-verbal. Parents are a powerful influence in shaping
      children’s food preferences and habits. If you prepare, eat and enjoy lots
      of nutritious foods, the chances are good that your child will eventually
      follow your healthy example.
